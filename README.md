Some configuration files (dotfiles), geared towards use on MacOS, with some
nix, tmux and neovim sprinkled in.

# Usage
Most of the files here slowly accreted. There was not much intelligent design
and hence this configuration will probably not suit anyone.
However, certain components (and links within source comments) might be
interesting to explore if you haven't heard of them yet:
- [Nix](https://nixos.org), a package manager, but also much more !
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), a very versatile fuzzy-finder.
- [zaw](https://github.com/zsh-users/zaw), in particular for easy access and
search of your `zsh` history.

# Installation
To install, one command:
```sh
$ ./install.sh
```

Run it again to update all of the components.

# TODOs
The [TODO.md](./TODO.md) file contains a hodgepodge of links related to configuration files.
